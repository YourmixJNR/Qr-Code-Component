## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Variable
- CSS Block
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

CSS Layout - Horizontal & Vertical Align.
Center Align Elements - To horizontally center a block element (like <main>), use margin: auto;

```html
<main>Some HTML code I'm proud of</main>
```
```css
main {
  margin: auto;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [PX to REM converter](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter) - This is an amazing web app that I used to convert PX to REM. I'd recommend it to anyone that find it difficult to convert PX to REM.
